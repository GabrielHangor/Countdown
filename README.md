# Countdown App

This is a simple training app based on HTML, CSS, JS, localstorage, JSON and focused on using the JS Date object.
* User has to input a specific date in the future (user is not able to input a date in the past) and name for that event.
* The input field gets hidden and the countdown starts.
* After the countdown ends user gets a notification. 
* Upon submitting the form the data is also storred in the local storage (JSON) so when the page is closed or refreshed the countdown is not reset.
